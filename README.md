# Tours Project

This project is a simple React application that displays a list of tours and allows users to remove tours they are not interested in. It fetches tour data from an external API and displays it in a user-friendly manner.

## Features

- View a list of tours with images, names, and prices.
- Read a brief description of each tour.
- Click on "Read More" to view the full description.
- Remove tours from the list if not interested.
- Refresh the tour list if no tours are left.
